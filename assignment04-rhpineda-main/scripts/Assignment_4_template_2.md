**Exercise 16:**
For each of the the following regions classify them as well- or poorly aligned, or uncertain/intermediate and explain your reasoning:

* 39.1K to 39.4K
  - check again This regions is poorly aligned because of the amount of gaps present in the alignment. There are also chunks of aligned sequences that have different nucleotides.
* 31.6K to 31.9K
  - This is poorly aligned as there are plenty of gaps with only a short stretches of sequences that are aligned.
* 24.7K to 24.9K
 - This is a well aligned regions as there are few gaps and few mismatches.
* 14.5K to 14.7K
 - This is an intermediate level of alignment as there are stretches of sequence with few mismatches but is interspersed with noticeable gaps

**Exercise 17:**

__A:__ What is the sister taxon to Seq_H? What is the host for the virus in this group (provide the Latin and common names)  
_hint: if you are having trouble finding Seq H in the tree, search for it using the (Aa) magnifying glass_
- Sister Taxon ID's
  - MG772934|SARS_coronavirus|China|Rhinolophus_sinicus
  - MG772933|SARS_coronavirus|China|Rhinolophus_sinicus

- Host
  - Latin: *Rhinolophus sinicus*
  - Common Name: Chinese rufous horseshoe bat

__B:__ Consider Seq_H plus its sister taxa as defining one taxonomic group with three members. Look at the sister taxon of this group (it is a large group). What is a general description for the viruses in this sister group? List at least 3 different hosts found in this group. Give Latin and common names (if there is a common name).

- The sister taxa are all generally coronaviruses, mostly SARS coronavirus or bat coronavirus.

- Hosts
  1. Least horseshoe bat (*Rhinolophus pusillus*) | From JX993987
  2. Greater horseshoe bat (*Rhinolophus ferrumequinum*) | From KY770860
  3. Wrinked-lipped free-tailed bat (*Chaerephon plicatus*) | From JX993988

__C:__ Now consider Seq_H plus all of the other taxa used in question __B__ as one taxonomic group.  The sister to this group has two members.  What are the hosts of this group.

- Sister ID
  - KY352407
  - NC_014470
  - GU190215

- Host
  - Horseshoe bats *Rhinolophus* | From KY352407
  - Blasius' horseshoe bat *Rhinolophus blasii* | From NC_014470 and GU190215
  
__D:__ Given your above findings, what do you think the host of the most recent common ancestor to the viruses in parts A and B was? (You can answer giving the common name for the general type of organism, e.g. rat, mouse, bat, ape, etc. you do not need to give a precise species).

- I believe that the most likely common ancestor to the viruses in part A and B were bats because using maximum parsimony that would require the least amount of evolutionary changes.

__E:__ Do you think that Seq_H evolved from a virus with a human host?  Why or why not?  If not, what did it evolve from? 

- I believe that Seq_H evolved from a virus from a bat. This is because the sister taxa also have bats as the host species. Seq_H evolving with a human host requires an additional evolutionary change.
